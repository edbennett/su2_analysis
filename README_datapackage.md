# Investigating the conformal behaviour of SU(2) with one adjoint Dirac flavor

## Data package for [arXiv:2103.10485][paper]

This package contains all data generated in preparing the publication [Investigating the conformal behaviour of SU(2) with one adjoint Dirac flavor][paper]. It includes four classes of data:

1. Raw data, as generated from the measurement code running on HPC, in their native formats.
2. Metadata around the analysis of the ensembles, in YAML format.
3. Data obtained by analysing the above data and presented in tables in [arXiv:2103:10485][paper], in sqlite3 format.
4. For convenience, the data in (1) above, repackaged in HDF5 format.

Each of these will be documented in more detail below.

Due to their size, raw gauge configurations are not included in this package.


## Data classes

### Raw data

Raw data are stored in the `raw_data.zip` file. This file contains a directory tree with the following levels:

* The top level indicates the number of flavours and, where appropriate, the fermion representation. In this work, directories are `nf0` and `nf1_ADJ`.
* The next level indicates the value of the coupling `beta`, prefixed with the letter `b`. This work presents four values of `beta` for `nf1_ADJ`: `b2.05`, `b2.15`, and `b2.2`; and two values of `beta` for `nf0`: `b2.4` and `b2.55`.
* The next level, where present, indicates the dynamical fermion mass, where appropriate, prefixed by the letter `m`. See Table III of [arXiv:2103.10485][paper] for a full listing.
* The next level indicates the lattice volume, in the form `NTxNS`, where `NT` and `NS` are the number of sites in the temporal and spatial directions respectively. (The three spatial directions have equal size.) Again, see Table III of [arXiv:2103.10485][paper] for a full listing.

This is sufficient to uniquely specify an ensemble. Within each such directory are one or more files, with filenames indicating their contents:

* `out_hmc`: the run history of the RHMC algorithm used to generate the gauge configurations, as generated by [HiRep][hirep] (`HMC/hmc`),
* `out_pl`: spatial and temporal Polyakov line calculations for each configuration, generated by [HiRep][hirep] (`StaticPotential/mk_polyakov_loops`),
* `out_corr`: mesonic and baryonic correlation functions, as generated by [HiRep][hirep] (`Spectrum/mk_mesons_with_z2semwall` and `Spectrum/measure_spectrum`),
* `out_wflow`: the history of the gradient flow computation, as generated by [HiRep][hirep] (`WilsonFlow/WF_measure`),
* `out_modenumber`: measurements of the Dirac mode number, as generated by [HiRep][hirep] (`ModeNumber/modenumber`)
* `out_corr_spin12`: correlation functions for various observables; for the purposes of this paper only used for computation of the mass of the spin-1/2 state, generated by a proprietary tool,
* `glue_correlation_matrix`: correlation matrices of gluonic observables, generated by a Fortran tool adjacent to but not included with [HiRep][hirep].

#### `out_hmc`

The HMC output details all the parameters used to set up the runs, and includes measurements of the plaquette after each trajectory. The format is a text-based log format, with lines starting with a label such as indicating the component reporting. Examples would be `[MAIN]` (indicating reports from the main iteration loop), `[GEOMETRY]` (indicating details of the arrangement of the lattice in memory), and `[RHMC]` (indicating details specific to the RHMC algorithm). Filtering on the word `Plaquette` was used to obtain the plaquette histories plotted in the publication.

#### `out_pl`

Polyakov loops are reported in a format similar to `out_hmc`. In addition to spatial and temporal Polyakov lines (labaled by `[POLYAKOV]`), this also reports the plaquettes in each orientation (labeled by `[PLAQ]`).

#### `out_corr`

These correlation functions are reported in a format similar to `out_hmc`. Results are on lines beginning `[MAIN][0]conf`. This prefix is followed by:

* The index of the configuration in the current configuration list (_not_ the trajectory identifier),
* `mass=`, followed by the valence mass used in the computation, which in this work is equal to the dynamical mass,
* The word `TRIPLET`, to indicate the computation is of a connected correlation function (`SINGLET`s are not considered in this work),
* The channel, followed by `=`, where the channel indicates the combination of gamma matrices and is described below,
* A space-separated list of the values of the correlation function, in which the number of entries is equal to the number of lattice sites in the time direction.

The majority of channels can be parsed into a more conventional notation by subscripting any digits and replacing each `g` with a gamma. Two exceptions to this are `id`, the identity, and `g5_g0g5_re`, which is used to compute the PCAC mass.

#### `out_wflow`

The gradient flow outut is reported in a format similar to `out_hmc`. Lines of interest are labeled by `[WILSONFLOW]`, followed by:

* `(ncnfg,t,E,t2*E,Esym,t2*Esym,TC) =`, an indication of what the following numbers on the line represent,
* the index of the configuration in the current configuration list (_not_ the trajectory identifier),
* the gradient flow time `t`,
* the density `E` as measured by the plaquette operator,
* the combination `t * t * E`,
* the density `E` as measured by the symmetric clover operator (`Esym`),
* the combination `t * t * Esym`,
* the topological charge of the configuration.

In this work, the flow time step is constant, as the adaptive flow was not used.

#### `out_modenumber`

The Dirac mode number measurements are reported in a format similar to `out_hmc`. Lines of interest are prefixed by `[MODENUMBER][0]nu[`, followed by

* the value below which we are counting eigenvalues (`Omega`),
* `] =`,
* the value of the mode number for this configuration.

As the mode number computation was not parallelised for this work, separate instances of the executable were invoked for each configuration and for each value of `Omega`; this results in a lot of redundant text.

The Chebychev polynomial is also reported in lines beginning `[MODENUMBER][0]c[`.

#### `out_corr_spin12`

Being generated by a different tool, the output format is different than the previous measurements.

Lines containing data start with `(MM)`, and are delimited by colons. The second column contains the trajectory index, and the subsequent columns before the last one or more fields identifying the specific measurement. Only the lines labeled `gluinoglue` were used in the calculation of the spin-1/2 state.

#### `glue_correlation_matrix`

Gluonic correlation matrices are generated by Fortran code and output in Fortran binary format. This file contains four records:
